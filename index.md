## Favorites CPSC 120L labs

Lab 5 
I think this lab was one of my favorites because of how we were using for-loops and also using them to calculate square roots. Something about this lab and learning how to calculate the square roots was the most challenging of this lab. There were some issues that were challenging on the way but I figured it out and the lab was pretty fun in the end.

Lab 6
Lab 6 was also one of my favorites because of how we were trying to add words to make mad libs. I think the part of trying to add ingredients or patterns was the most interesting part about this lab. The program of putting an input and getting an output of a string of words is what I like trying to do but also a bit challenging. 

Lab 8
Another lab that was my favorite was lab 8 because you were adding up the minimum and maximum with olympic scores. I think something that was challenging about this lab was how you’re also eliminating either the least score or the greatest. Finding the average of the olympic scores was also something I like doing during the lab to.
